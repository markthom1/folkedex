Gotta snap 'em all


---

## Technologies used:
* **Node.js**
* **Express**
* **Passport Authentication**
* **Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API**
* **React**

## How to use the app:
Log-in to app.
Inside the app you'll have the ability to:
  - Find other users
  - Request/Accept requests from other users
  - See profile with profile pic, friends and folks.
  - Reach the page where photos can be uploaded via url.
  - Navigate to Ranking page to see rankings
  - Navigate to Play page to play games
  - Logout

## Approach taken:
I worked on the database and backend first. This process went quite smoothly.
Once developed what data the backend will store and send, I worked on the front-
end. The front end took up the majority of my time.

---

## Unsolved problems:
Working out bugs with routing, especially to render the Profile component for
different users.

Getting the homepage slideshow to work was unresolved at the time of submission.
However, I did some research and there is a react-slick package that makes
implementing a slideshow very easily.

## Notes to self:
* Tryout react-slick for the slideshow.
* Get camera and image save working.
* Try Cloudinary for image hosting.
* Work on react-native version of this.
